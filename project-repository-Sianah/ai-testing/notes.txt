Give GPT reason 
-Make questions from text it would use to diagnose a person with an allergy
-Give bullet points potentially
-Use RAG method
-Possibility: Start with symptom
- PLease determine if you can gauge users allergies based on input, if not ask for further information
- Algorithm then for gpt would ask for further information based on articles given to make beter clarification 
- Loop it based : do you think you know what allergy they have or do you need more information
-Explain what the answer would be. Needs to produce explanation. DOn't ask it two things, but ask it a second time
 - think of A, B, C, D scenario
- Did you say you need more information, just type true or false(ask gpt)
- Gpt may say it can't do that, talk to a doctor (workaround that)
- emphasize what you learned and what it needs to do
