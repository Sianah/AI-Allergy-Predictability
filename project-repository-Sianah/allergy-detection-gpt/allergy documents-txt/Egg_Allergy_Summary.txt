
Introduction to Egg Allergy:
- Egg allergy occurs when the immune system overreacts to proteins in egg whites and/or yolks, treating them as foreign invaders.
- It's estimated that up to 2 percent of children are allergic to eggs, but about 70 percent outgrow the allergy by age 16.
- Reactions can range from mild rashes to anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction.

Symptoms of Egg Allergy:
- Vomiting, stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea
- Wheezing, shortness of breath, repetitive cough
- Tightness in throat, hoarse voice, weak pulse
- Pale or blue skin coloring, hives, swelling (including tongue and/or lips)
- Dizziness, confusion
- Skin reactions (e.g., swelling, rash, hives, eczema)
- Runny nose, sneezing, red or watery eyes
- Stomach pain, nausea
- Anaphylaxis in less common cases

Diagnosis of Egg Allergy:
- Skin-prick tests and blood tests can identify the presence of antibodies against egg protein.
- Oral food challenges or food elimination diets may be used to confirm the allergy.
- Allergies to chicken eggs may also imply allergies to other types of eggs (e.g., goose, duck, turkey, quail).

Management and Treatment of Egg Allergy:
- The primary treatment is to avoid eating eggs and egg-containing products.
- Eggs are hidden ingredients in many foods (e.g., canned soups, salad dressings, ice cream, meat-based dishes), making avoidance challenging.
- Some commercial egg substitutes may contain egg protein.
