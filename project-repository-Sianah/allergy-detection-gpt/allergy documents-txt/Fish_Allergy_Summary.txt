
Overview of Fish Allergy:
- Fish allergy can appear in adulthood, unlike most food allergies that are noticed in babies and young children.
- Up to 40% of people with a fish allergy did not have issues with fish until they were adults.
- Being allergic to finned fish does not automatically mean an allergy to shellfish, and vice versa.
- Allergists can help determine if someone allergic to one type of fish may safely eat other types.

Symptoms of Fish Allergy:
- Hives or skin rash
- Nausea, stomach cramps, indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea
- Stuffy or runny nose, sneezing
- Headaches, asthma
- Anaphylaxis, a less common but potentially life-threatening reaction

Fish Allergy Management and Treatment:
- Avoidance of fish and fish products is crucial.
- Careful reading of food labels to avoid fish ingredients.
- Use of epinephrine to treat symptoms of anaphylaxis.

Diagnosis of Fish Allergy:
- Allergists may use skin-prick tests or blood tests to diagnose a fish allergy.
- Oral food challenges may be conducted under medical supervision if tests are not definitive.
