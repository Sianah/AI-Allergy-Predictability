Overview of Food Allergies:
- Approximately 6% of U.S. adults and children have a food allergy.
- Food allergies can appear at any age and may develop even against foods previously consumed without issues.

Common Food Allergens:
- The eight types of food account for about 90% of all allergic reactions: Eggs, Milk and Dairy, Peanuts, Tree nuts, Fish, Shellfish, Wheat, Soy, and Sesame.
- Sesame is the ninth most common food allergen as recognized by the FDA under the FASTER Act of 2021.

Symptoms of Food Allergies:
- Can involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and respiratory tract, ranging from vomiting and stomach cramps to anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening reaction.

Triggers:
- Avoidance of specific allergenic foods is the most effective treatment.
- Cross-reactivity can occur, meaning an allergy to one food might result in reactions to related foods.

Diagnosis and Testing:
- Allergic reactions to food generally cause some sort of reaction every time the trigger food is consumed.
- Diagnosis involves detailed questioning about your medical history and symptoms, and it may include tests to confirm the presence of an allergy.
