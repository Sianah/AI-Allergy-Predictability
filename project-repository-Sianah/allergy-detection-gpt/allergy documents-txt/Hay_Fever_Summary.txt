
Overview of Hay Fever:
- Hay fever, or allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms without being caused by a virus.
- It's triggered by an allergic response to outdoor or indoor substances considered harmful by the body.
- Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.
- Hay fever can significantly affect performance at work or school and overall quality of life but can be managed by avoiding triggers and finding suitable treatments.

Symptoms of Hay Fever:
- Runny nose, nasal congestion, watery/itchy/red eyes, sneezing, cough
- Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat, postnasal drip
- Swollen skin under the eyes, fatigue due to poor sleep

Hay Fever Triggers:
- Seasonal: Tree, grass, and ragweed pollen
- Year-round: Dust mites, cockroach droppings, pet dander, and spores from fungi and molds

Differentiating Hay Fever from Common Cold:
- Hay fever: Symptoms include a runny nose with thin, watery discharge immediately after allergen exposure, lasting as long as exposure continues.
- Common cold: Symptoms involve a runny nose with watery or thick yellow discharge, body aches, low-grade fever, starting 1 to 3 days after virus exposure and lasting 3 to 7 days.

When to See a Doctor:
- If hay fever symptoms are severe or persistent and medications do not provide relief or cause side effects.
- If other conditions that can worsen hay fever symptoms are present.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Hay fever is caused by the immune system's overreaction to harmless substances.
- Risk factors include having other allergies or asthma, atopic dermatitis, a family history of allergies, or exposure to irritants like smoke.

Complications:
- Can lead to reduced quality of life, poor sleep, worsening asthma, sinusitis, and ear infections in children.

Prevention:
- Avoiding exposure to allergens and taking allergy medications as directed can help manage symptoms.
