
Overview of Milk Allergy:
- Between 2% and 3% of children under 3 years old are allergic to milk.
- Contrary to past beliefs, fewer than 20% of children outgrow their milk allergy by age 4, but about 80% do so before turning 16.
- Allergists are trained to assess milk and dairy allergies at all ages.

Symptoms of Milk Allergy:
- Hives, stomach upset, vomiting
- Bloody stools, especially in infants
- Anaphylaxis, a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction

Milk Allergy Management and Treatment:
- Avoid milk, other dairy products, and products containing milk protein; always read labels carefully.
- Administer epinephrine (adrenaline) for severe symptoms.

Commonality and Cross-Reactivity:
- Milk is one of the most common food allergens.
- Individuals allergic to cowâ€™s milk may also react to milk from other animals, such as sheep and goats.

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosis involves a detailed history, skin-prick tests, or blood tests to detect the presence of IgE antibodies.
- Skin-prick tests involve exposing the skin to milk or milk protein extract to observe allergic reactions.
