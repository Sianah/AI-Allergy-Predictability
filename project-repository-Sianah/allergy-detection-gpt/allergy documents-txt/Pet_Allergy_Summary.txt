
Overview of Pet Allergy:
- Pet allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in an animal's skin cells, saliva, or urine.
- It is most commonly triggered by dead skin flakes (dander) shed by pets, especially cats and dogs.
- Strategies include avoiding or reducing exposure to animals and possibly needing medications or treatments to relieve symptoms and manage asthma.

Symptoms of Pet Allergy:
- Common symptoms mimic those of hay fever, such as sneezing and runny nose, and can include asthma signs like wheezing and difficulty breathing.
- Pet allergy may cause skin symptoms known as allergic dermatitis, leading to raised, red patches of skin (hives), eczema, and itchy skin.

Causes:
- Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance like pet dander.
- The immune system produces antibodies that identify the allergen as harmful, causing an inflammatory response.

Risk Factors:
- Pet allergies are more likely if allergies or asthma run in your family.
- Early exposure to pets may reduce the risk of developing pet allergies.

Complications:
- Chronic inflammation from pet allergy can lead to sinus infections and complicate asthma, potentially leading to severe asthma attacks.

Prevention:
- Before getting a pet, ensure you do not have pet allergies if considering adoption or purchase.
