
Overview of Shellfish Allergy:
- Shellfish is one of the most common food allergens.
- A shellfish allergy is distinct from a fish allergy, allowing for the potential to consume fish without issues.
- Shellfish allergies can develop in both adults and children.

Symptoms of Shellfish Allergy:
- Symptoms can range from vomiting, stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea, wheezing, and shortness of breath to repetitive cough, tightness in the throat, weak pulse, pale or blue skin coloring, hives, swelling (including of the tongue and/or lips), dizziness, and confusion.

Triggers of Shellfish Allergy:
- The crustacean group (shrimp, lobster, crab) within the shellfish family causes the most allergic reactions.
- Many individuals with a shellfish allergy can still tolerate mollusks (scallops, oysters, clams, and mussels), but caution is advised due to potential cross-contamination in restaurants and markets.

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosing shellfish allergies can be complex due to the variability of symptoms among individuals and the same individual's different reactions.
- Allergic reactions can occur without ingesting shellfish directly, such as being near cooking shellfish or consuming food that has come into contact with shellfish.
