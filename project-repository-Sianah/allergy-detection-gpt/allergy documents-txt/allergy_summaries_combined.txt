
Introduction to Dust Mites:
- Tiny creatures called dust mites may cause allergies or asthma in some individuals.
- They are invisible to the naked eye but can trigger allergic reactions.
- Dust mites are a common trigger of year-round allergies and allergic asthma worldwide, except in Antarctica.
- Completely eliminating dust mites from homes may not be possible, but reducing allergic reactions to them is achievable.

Dust Mite Allergy Symptoms:
- Sneezing
- Runny nose
- Itchy, red, or watery eyes
- Stuffy nose
- Itchy nose, mouth, or throat
- Itchy skin
- Postnasal drip (mucus flow from behind the nose into the throat)
- For those with asthma, symptoms can include difficulty breathing, chest tightness or pain, a whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling, and sleep disturbances due to breathing issues.

Diagnosing Dust Mite Allergy:
- The text implies there are methods for diagnosing dust mite allergy but does not detail them directly.

Treatment for Dust Mite Allergy:
- Specific treatments for dust mite allergy are suggested but not elaborated upon in the provided text.

Preventing Allergic Reactions to Dust Mites:
- While the text suggests ways to prevent allergic reactions to dust mites, it does not provide specific strategies within the excerpt.



Introduction to Egg Allergy:
- Egg allergy occurs when the immune system overreacts to proteins in egg whites and/or yolks, treating them as foreign invaders.
- It's estimated that up to 2 percent of children are allergic to eggs, but about 70 percent outgrow the allergy by age 16.
- Reactions can range from mild rashes to anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction.

Symptoms of Egg Allergy:
- Vomiting, stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea
- Wheezing, shortness of breath, repetitive cough
- Tightness in throat, hoarse voice, weak pulse
- Pale or blue skin coloring, hives, swelling (including tongue and/or lips)
- Dizziness, confusion
- Skin reactions (e.g., swelling, rash, hives, eczema)
- Runny nose, sneezing, red or watery eyes
- Stomach pain, nausea
- Anaphylaxis in less common cases

Diagnosis of Egg Allergy:
- Skin-prick tests and blood tests can identify the presence of antibodies against egg protein.
- Oral food challenges or food elimination diets may be used to confirm the allergy.
- Allergies to chicken eggs may also imply allergies to other types of eggs (e.g., goose, duck, turkey, quail).

Management and Treatment of Egg Allergy:
- The primary treatment is to avoid eating eggs and egg-containing products.
- Eggs are hidden ingredients in many foods (e.g., canned soups, salad dressings, ice cream, meat-based dishes), making avoidance challenging.
- Some commercial egg substitutes may contain egg protein.


Overview of Food Allergies:
- Approximately 6% of U.S. adults and children have a food allergy.
- Food allergies can appear at any age and may develop even against foods previously consumed without issues.

Common Food Allergens:
- The eight types of food account for about 90% of all allergic reactions: Eggs, Milk and Dairy, Peanuts, Tree nuts, Fish, Shellfish, Wheat, Soy, and Sesame.
- Sesame is the ninth most common food allergen as recognized by the FDA under the FASTER Act of 2021.

Symptoms of Food Allergies:
- Can involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and respiratory tract, ranging from vomiting and stomach cramps to anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening reaction.

Triggers:
- Avoidance of specific allergenic foods is the most effective treatment.
- Cross-reactivity can occur, meaning an allergy to one food might result in reactions to related foods.

Diagnosis and Testing:
- Allergic reactions to food generally cause some sort of reaction every time the trigger food is consumed.
- Diagnosis involves detailed questioning about your medical history and symptoms, and it may include tests to confirm the presence of an allergy.


Overview of Fish Allergy:
- Fish allergy can appear in adulthood, unlike most food allergies that are noticed in babies and young children.
- Up to 40% of people with a fish allergy did not have issues with fish until they were adults.
- Being allergic to finned fish does not automatically mean an allergy to shellfish, and vice versa.
- Allergists can help determine if someone allergic to one type of fish may safely eat other types.

Symptoms of Fish Allergy:
- Hives or skin rash
- Nausea, stomach cramps, indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea
- Stuffy or runny nose, sneezing
- Headaches, asthma
- Anaphylaxis, a less common but potentially life-threatening reaction

Fish Allergy Management and Treatment:
- Avoidance of fish and fish products is crucial.
- Careful reading of food labels to avoid fish ingredients.
- Use of epinephrine to treat symptoms of anaphylaxis.

Diagnosis of Fish Allergy:
- Allergists may use skin-prick tests or blood tests to diagnose a fish allergy.
- Oral food challenges may be conducted under medical supervision if tests are not definitive.



Overview of Hay Fever:
- Hay fever, or allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms without being caused by a virus.
- It's triggered by an allergic response to outdoor or indoor substances considered harmful by the body.
- Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.
- Hay fever can significantly affect performance at work or school and overall quality of life but can be managed by avoiding triggers and finding suitable treatments.

Symptoms of Hay Fever:
- Runny nose, nasal congestion, watery/itchy/red eyes, sneezing, cough
- Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat, postnasal drip
- Swollen skin under the eyes, fatigue due to poor sleep

Hay Fever Triggers:
- Seasonal: Tree, grass, and ragweed pollen
- Year-round: Dust mites, cockroach droppings, pet dander, and spores from fungi and molds

Differentiating Hay Fever from Common Cold:
- Hay fever: Symptoms include a runny nose with thin, watery discharge immediately after allergen exposure, lasting as long as exposure continues.
- Common cold: Symptoms involve a runny nose with watery or thick yellow discharge, body aches, low-grade fever, starting 1 to 3 days after virus exposure and lasting 3 to 7 days.

When to See a Doctor:
- If hay fever symptoms are severe or persistent and medications do not provide relief or cause side effects.
- If other conditions that can worsen hay fever symptoms are present.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Hay fever is caused by the immune system's overreaction to harmless substances.
- Risk factors include having other allergies or asthma, atopic dermatitis, a family history of allergies, or exposure to irritants like smoke.

Complications:
- Can lead to reduced quality of life, poor sleep, worsening asthma, sinusitis, and ear infections in children.

Prevention:
- Avoiding exposure to allergens and taking allergy medications as directed can help manage symptoms.



Overview of Milk Allergy:
- Between 2% and 3% of children under 3 years old are allergic to milk.
- Contrary to past beliefs, fewer than 20% of children outgrow their milk allergy by age 4, but about 80% do so before turning 16.
- Allergists are trained to assess milk and dairy allergies at all ages.

Symptoms of Milk Allergy:
- Hives, stomach upset, vomiting
- Bloody stools, especially in infants
- Anaphylaxis, a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction

Milk Allergy Management and Treatment:
- Avoid milk, other dairy products, and products containing milk protein; always read labels carefully.
- Administer epinephrine (adrenaline) for severe symptoms.

Commonality and Cross-Reactivity:
- Milk is one of the most common food allergens.
- Individuals allergic to cowâ€™s milk may also react to milk from other animals, such as sheep and goats.

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosis involves a detailed history, skin-prick tests, or blood tests to detect the presence of IgE antibodies.
- Skin-prick tests involve exposing the skin to milk or milk protein extract to observe allergic reactions.



Overview of Peanut Allergy:
- Peanut allergy can cause life-threatening reactions, including anaphylaxis, necessitating immediate treatment.
- Awareness and reported cases of peanut allergy in children have risen, with a 2017 study indicating a 21% increase since 2010.
- Peanuts are legumes, not tree nuts, and up to 20% of individuals with a peanut allergy may outgrow it.

Symptoms of Peanut Allergy:
- Severe allergic reactions can lead to anaphylaxis, which requires immediate treatment with epinephrine.
- Symptoms can include vomiting, stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea, wheezing, shortness of breath, repetitive cough, tightness in the throat, hoarse voice, weak pulse, pale or blue skin, hives, swelling of the tongue and/or lips, dizziness, and confusion.

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosing peanut allergy can be complex, as symptoms vary between individuals and across different reactions.
- Keeping a food diary and tracking reactions to suspect foods can help in diagnosing a peanut allergy.



Overview of Pet Allergy:
- Pet allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in an animal's skin cells, saliva, or urine.
- It is most commonly triggered by dead skin flakes (dander) shed by pets, especially cats and dogs.
- Strategies include avoiding or reducing exposure to animals and possibly needing medications or treatments to relieve symptoms and manage asthma.

Symptoms of Pet Allergy:
- Common symptoms mimic those of hay fever, such as sneezing and runny nose, and can include asthma signs like wheezing and difficulty breathing.
- Pet allergy may cause skin symptoms known as allergic dermatitis, leading to raised, red patches of skin (hives), eczema, and itchy skin.

Causes:
- Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance like pet dander.
- The immune system produces antibodies that identify the allergen as harmful, causing an inflammatory response.

Risk Factors:
- Pet allergies are more likely if allergies or asthma run in your family.
- Early exposure to pets may reduce the risk of developing pet allergies.

Complications:
- Chronic inflammation from pet allergy can lead to sinus infections and complicate asthma, potentially leading to severe asthma attacks.

Prevention:
- Before getting a pet, ensure you do not have pet allergies if considering adoption or purchase.



Overview of Shellfish Allergy:
- Shellfish is one of the most common food allergens.
- A shellfish allergy is distinct from a fish allergy, allowing for the potential to consume fish without issues.
- Shellfish allergies can develop in both adults and children.

Symptoms of Shellfish Allergy:
- Symptoms can range from vomiting, stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea, wheezing, and shortness of breath to repetitive cough, tightness in the throat, weak pulse, pale or blue skin coloring, hives, swelling (including of the tongue and/or lips), dizziness, and confusion.

Triggers of Shellfish Allergy:
- The crustacean group (shrimp, lobster, crab) within the shellfish family causes the most allergic reactions.
- Many individuals with a shellfish allergy can still tolerate mollusks (scallops, oysters, clams, and mussels), but caution is advised due to potential cross-contamination in restaurants and markets.

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosing shellfish allergies can be complex due to the variability of symptoms among individuals and the same individual's different reactions.
- Allergic reactions can occur without ingesting shellfish directly, such as being near cooking shellfish or consuming food that has come into contact with shellfish.



Overview of Soy Allergy:
- Soy, a member of the legume family, is a common food allergen, especially in infants and young children under 3.
- Many children outgrow the allergy during their childhood.
- Soy is found in various processed foods, including some infant formulas, soy milk, and soy sauce.

Common Triggers:
- Soy and soy products are the primary triggers of a soy allergy.

Management of Soy Allergy:
- The key to managing a soy allergy is avoiding products containing soy, which involves careful label reading.
- Be prepared to treat allergic reactions, as they can be unpredictable. Having epinephrine autoinjectors readily available is crucial for treating severe reactions or anaphylaxis.

Symptoms of Soy Allergy:
- Symptoms include vomiting, stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea, wheezing, shortness of breath, repetitive cough, tightness in the throat, hoarse voice, weak pulse, pale or blue skin, hives, swelling (including the tongue and/or lips), dizziness, and confusion.
- Anaphylaxis is a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction associated with soy allergy, treatable only with epinephrine.

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosing soy allergies is complex, with symptoms varying between individuals and even in the same individual across different reactions.



Overview of Tree Nut Allergy:
- Tree nut allergy is often associated with anaphylaxis, a serious and potentially fatal allergic reaction.
- The allergy usually lasts a lifetime, with fewer than 10% of individuals outgrowing it.
- There is confusion between peanuts (legumes) and tree nuts, but 25% to 40% of people allergic to peanuts also react to at least one type of tree nut.

Symptoms of Tree Nut Allergy:
- Abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Difficulty swallowing
- Itching of the mouth, throat, eyes, skin, or any other area
- Nasal congestion or a runny nose, nausea, shortness of breath
- Anaphylaxis, a less common but severe reaction that impairs breathing and can cause shock

Tree Nut Allergy Triggers:
- Tree nuts and their products, including nut oils and butters

Management and Treatment of Tree Nut Allergy:
- Avoidance of nuts and nut products; careful reading of ingredient labels is crucial.
- Administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) as soon as severe symptoms develop is essential for managing severe reactions.


Overview of Wheat Allergy:
- Develops when the body's immune system overreacts to wheat.
- More likely if there is a family history of allergies or allergic diseases.
- Symptoms range from mild (e.g., hives, nausea, respiratory issues) to severe (e.g., anaphylaxis).
- Triggers include wheat-containing foods and non-food products.

Symptoms of Wheat Allergy:
- Hives or skin rash.
- Nausea, stomach cramps, indigestion, vomiting, or diarrhea.
- Stuffy or runny nose; sneezing; headaches.
